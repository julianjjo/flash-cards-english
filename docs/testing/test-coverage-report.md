# Quick coverage check
npm run test:coverage

# Comprehensive coverage analysis
node tests/scripts/generate-coverage-report.js

# Coverage with threshold validation
node tests/scripts/generate-coverage-report.js --threshold-statements=95
```

### Viewing Reports
```bash
# Open HTML coverage report
open coverage/index.html

# View coverage in terminal
npm run test:coverage -- --verbose
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Low Branch Coverage**
- Add tests for conditional logic
- Test error handling paths
- Validate input edge cases
- Test different user roles and permissions

**Low Function Coverage**
- Test all exported functions
- Include private function testing where appropriate
- Test callback and event handler functions
- Validate async function execution paths

**Low Statement Coverage**
- Remove dead code
- Test all code paths
- Include error handling statements
- Validate configuration and setup code

**E2E Coverage Gaps**
- Test complete user workflows
- Include cross-browser scenarios
- Validate mobile responsive design
- Test performance under load

### Performance Optimization
- Use Jest's `--coverage` flag selectively
- Configure coverage collection patterns
- Optimize test execution with parallelization
- Use coverage caching for faster builds

## Contributing

### Coverage Requirements
- New features must include comprehensive tests
- Pull requests must maintain or improve coverage
- Critical paths require 100% test coverage
- Documentation must include coverage impact

### Review Process
- Coverage reports reviewed in PR process
- Significant coverage changes require discussion
- New test patterns should be documented
- Coverage tools and scripts are maintained collaboratively
