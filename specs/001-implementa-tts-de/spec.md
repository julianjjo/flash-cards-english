# Feature Specification: Replace ElevenLabs TTS with Gemini TTS

**Feature Branch**: `001-implementa-tts-de`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "implementa tts de gemini cambialo por el que se usa actualmente"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature request: Replace current ElevenLabs TTS with Google Gemini TTS
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: flashcard users, system
   ‚Üí Actions: generate audio, play pronunciation
   ‚Üí Data: text content (English/Spanish), audio files
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain existing functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Voice selection preferences for Spanish/English]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Audio quality requirements and file size constraints]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: same as current TTS but using Gemini instead of ElevenLabs
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí All requirements focus on TTS functionality replacement
6. Identify Key Entities: Audio content, flashcard text
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec has some uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a flashcard user, I want to hear the pronunciation of English and Spanish words/phrases so that I can learn proper pronunciation. The audio should be generated using Google Gemini's text-to-speech capabilities instead of the current ElevenLabs service, maintaining the same quality and user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a flashcard with English text, **When** user requests audio pronunciation, **Then** system generates and plays clear English audio using Gemini TTS
2. **Given** a flashcard with Spanish text, **When** user requests audio pronunciation, **Then** system generates and plays clear Spanish audio using Gemini TTS  
3. **Given** the system previously used ElevenLabs TTS, **When** the feature is implemented, **Then** users experience no functional difference in audio quality or availability
4. **Given** a user requests audio for the same text multiple times, **When** audio is requested, **Then** system efficiently handles the request without unnecessary delays

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Gemini TTS service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does system handle very long text passages that exceed TTS limits?
- What happens when text contains special characters or mixed languages?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate audio pronunciations using Google Gemini TTS service
- **FR-002**: System MUST support both English and Spanish text-to-speech conversion
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain the same user interface and interaction patterns as current TTS implementation
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle audio file generation and delivery to the frontend
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide error handling when TTS service is unavailable
- **FR-006**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific voice selection - male/female, accent preferences for Spanish/English]
- **FR-007**: Audio files MUST meet [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: quality requirements - bitrate, format, duration limits]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: caching strategy for generated audio - temporary/persistent storage]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Audio Content**: Generated speech files with properties like language, text source, duration, and format
- **Flashcard Text**: Source text content that needs to be converted to speech, including language metadata
