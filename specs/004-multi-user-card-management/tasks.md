# Tasks: Multi-User Card Management Implementation

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Date Completed**: 2025-09-07

## Overview
Implementation of multi-user card management system with user isolation, card sharing, and permission-based access control.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: User Association
- [x] **T048**: Add card creation with user association
  - Modified POST /api/cards endpoint to include authenticateToken middleware
  - Updated card creation to save user_id from authenticated user's JWT token  
  - Added user association to all newly created cards
  - **File**: `server/index.js:795`

### Phase 2: User Isolation  
- [x] **T049**: Update card endpoints to respect user ownership
  - Modified all card CRUD endpoints (GET, PUT, DELETE) to include WHERE user_id clauses
  - Added authentication middleware to all card endpoints
  - Ensured users can only access/modify their own cards
  - **Files**: `server/index.js:752,886,934,942,956,1002,1058`

### Phase 3: User-Specific Filtering
- [x] **T050**: Implement user-specific card filtering
  - Updated GET /api/cards to return only cards owned by the authenticated user
  - Updated GET /api/cards/next (spaced repetition) to filter by user_id
  - Added union query to include both owned and shared cards
  - **Files**: `server/index.js:752,942`

### Phase 4: Card Sharing System
- [x] **T051**: Add card sharing and permissions
  - Created card_shares database table with permissions system (read/write)
  - Implemented checkCardAccess() helper function for access control
  - Added sharing endpoints:
    - POST /api/cards/:id/share - Share card with another user
    - GET /api/cards/:id/shares - List shares for a card
    - DELETE /api/cards/:id/shares/:shareId - Remove a share
  - Updated card modification endpoints to respect sharing permissions
  - **Files**: `server/index.js:1098-1215`, SQLite schema update

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- [x] **T052**: Test multi-user card management  
  - Created test users and verified user isolation
  - Tested that users only see their own cards
  - Created card sharing records and verified access control
  - Confirmed sharing functionality works at database level
  - **Testing**: Manual API testing with curl commands

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Added to existing cards table
ALTER TABLE cards ADD COLUMN user_id INTEGER;

-- New card_shares table
CREATE TABLE card_shares (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  card_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  shared_by_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  shared_with_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  permission TEXT DEFAULT 'read' CHECK(permission IN ('read', 'write')),
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (card_id) REFERENCES cards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (shared_by_user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (shared_with_user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  UNIQUE(card_id, shared_with_user_id)
);
```

### Key Features Implemented

1. **User Isolation**: Each user only sees their own cards by default
2. **Permission-based Sharing**: Cards can be shared with 'read' or 'write' permissions  
3. **Access Control**: All endpoints respect ownership and sharing permissions
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing cards maintain functionality
5. **Secure Access**: JWT token-based authentication for all card operations

### API Endpoints Added/Modified

**Card Management (Modified)**:
- GET /api/cards - Now includes shared cards with access_type and permission info
- POST /api/cards - Associates new cards with authenticated user
- PUT /api/cards/:id - Requires write permission (owner or shared with write)
- DELETE /api/cards/:id - Requires ownership only
- GET /api/cards/next - Includes both owned and shared cards for spaced repetition
- POST /api/cards/:id/review - Allows review of shared cards, but only owners can update spaced repetition data
- POST /api/cards/:id/regenerate-audio - Requires write permission
- POST /api/cards/:id/regenerate-tips - Requires write permission

**Card Sharing (New)**:
- POST /api/cards/:id/share - Share card with user by email
- GET /api/cards/:id/shares - List all shares for a card (owner only)
- DELETE /api/cards/:id/shares/:shareId - Remove share (owner only)

### Helper Functions Added

**checkCardAccess(cardId, userId)**:
- Returns: { hasAccess, permission, isOwner, card }
- Checks both ownership and sharing permissions
- Used by all card modification endpoints

### Permission Model

- **Owner**: Full access (read, write, share, delete)
- **Shared (write)**: Can view, modify content, regenerate audio/tips
- **Shared (read)**: Can view and review cards, but no modifications
- **No Access**: Cannot see or interact with card

## Status Summary

✅ **All tasks completed successfully**
✅ **Multi-user isolation working**
✅ **Card sharing system functional**  
✅ **Permission-based access control implemented**
✅ **Backward compatibility maintained**

## Next Steps (If Needed)

- Frontend UI for card sharing (not in current scope)
- Bulk sharing operations
- Share notifications
- Advanced permission levels
- Share expiration dates
