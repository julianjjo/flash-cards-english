# Feature Specification: Independent User Management with Per-User Flashcards

**Feature Branch**: `002-mejora-el-manejo`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "mejora el manejo de usuarios para que sea independiente y sea posible crear flash cards para cada usuario"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Independent user management system with per-user flashcard isolation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Individual users, Admin users
   ‚Üí Actions: User registration, login, create/manage personal flashcards, admin oversight
   ‚Üí Data: User profiles, user-specific flashcard collections, user progress tracking
   ‚Üí Constraints: Data isolation between users, authentication required
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication method not specified - email/password, social login, or other?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User registration process - self-registration or admin-only?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Admin capabilities - can admins view/modify all user data or limited access?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User registers ‚Üí logs in ‚Üí creates personal flashcards ‚Üí studies with spaced repetition
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí User authentication, data isolation, personal flashcard management, progress tracking
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí User, UserFlashcard, UserSession, UserProgress
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarification needed on auth method and registration process"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A person learning Spanish wants to create their own personalized flashcard collection separate from other users. They need to register for an account, log in securely, create their own flashcards, and track their learning progress independently without seeing or interfering with other users' content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the application, **When** they complete registration, **Then** they receive their own private account with empty flashcard collection
2. **Given** a registered user logs in, **When** they create a new flashcard, **Then** the flashcard is saved only to their personal collection and not visible to other users
3. **Given** a user has personal flashcards, **When** they study and mark difficulty levels, **Then** their progress is tracked independently and affects only their spaced repetition schedule
4. **Given** multiple users are using the system, **When** User A creates or modifies flashcards, **Then** User B sees no changes in their personal flashcard collection
5. **Given** a user logs out and logs back in, **When** they access their flashcards, **Then** all their personal content and progress is preserved exactly as they left it

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user forgets their login credentials?
- How does system handle duplicate registration attempts with same email?
- What happens if a user tries to access another user's flashcard data directly?
- How does the system behave when a user account is deleted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow new users to create personal accounts
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate users before allowing access to flashcard features
- **FR-003**: System MUST isolate each user's flashcard collection from other users
- **FR-004**: System MUST track learning progress (difficulty, review count, last reviewed) separately for each user
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to create, edit, and delete only their own flashcards
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain spaced repetition scheduling independently for each user
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve all user data (flashcards, progress) across login sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent users from accessing or modifying other users' flashcard data
- **FR-009**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, social login, or other?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle user registration via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: self-registration allowed or admin-only creation?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide admin users with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what level of access to user data - full access, limited oversight, or read-only?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents an individual learner with unique credentials, personal flashcard collection, and learning progress
- **UserFlashcard**: Individual flashcard belonging to a specific user, containing english/spanish text, difficulty level, and review history
- **UserSession**: Active login session linking user authentication to their personal data access
- **UserProgress**: Learning statistics and spaced repetition data specific to each user's study patterns
