# Feature Specification: Visual User Management Interface Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `003-implementa-todo-lo`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "implementa todo lo visual cambios de interfaces para el manejo de usuario que se implemento en back login registro y administraci√≥n"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature requests visual implementation for user management system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users, Admins
   ‚Üí Actions: Login, Registration, Administration
   ‚Üí Data: User accounts, authentication states
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must match existing backend API
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [COVERED: Backend API already implemented, specs clear from existing code]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows for authentication and admin management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable against existing backend
6. Identify Key Entities (User, Admin, Authentication State)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Implementation guidance clear from existing backend
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need a complete visual interface to interact with the user management system that was implemented on the backend. This includes the ability to register new accounts, login to existing accounts, manage their profile, and for administrators to manage other users through a dedicated admin interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Authentication Flow
1. **Given** a new user visits the application, **When** they select "Register", **Then** they see a registration form with fields for email and password
2. **Given** a user has entered valid registration details, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they are successfully registered and logged in
3. **Given** an existing user visits the application, **When** they select "Login", **Then** they see a login form with email and password fields
4. **Given** a user enters valid login credentials, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the main application
5. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they select "Logout", **Then** they are logged out and returned to the authentication screen

#### User Profile Management
6. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they access their profile, **Then** they can view and edit their account information
7. **Given** a user wants to change their password, **When** they access password change functionality, **Then** they can securely update their password
8. **Given** a user wants to delete their account, **When** they request account deletion, **Then** they receive confirmation and their account is properly removed

#### Admin Management Interface
9. **Given** an admin user is logged in, **When** they access the admin panel, **Then** they see a list of all users in the system
10. **Given** an admin viewing the user list, **When** they select a user, **Then** they can view that user's details and available actions
11. **Given** an admin wants to promote a user, **When** they select the promotion action, **Then** the user's role is updated to admin
12. **Given** an admin wants to delete a user, **When** they confirm the deletion, **Then** the user and all their data are removed from the system

### Edge Cases
- What happens when login credentials are incorrect? User sees clear error message
- How does system handle registration with existing email? Clear validation error shown
- What happens if admin tries to delete themselves? System prevents self-deletion with warning
- How are form validation errors displayed? Inline validation with clear error messages
- What happens during network errors? Loading states and retry mechanisms provided

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain authentication state across page refreshes

#### Admin Management Interface
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide an admin panel accessible only to admin users
- **FR-017**: System MUST display a searchable and sortable list of all users
- **FR-018**: System MUST show user details including role, registration date, and activity
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow admins to promote users to admin role
- **FR-020**: System MUST allow admins to demote admin users to regular users
- **FR-021**: System MUST allow admins to delete user accounts with confirmation
- **FR-022**: System MUST prevent admins from deleting their own accounts
