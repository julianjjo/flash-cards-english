# Quickstart: Visual User Management Interface Testing

## Overview
This quickstart guide validates the implementation of visual user management interfaces by walking through complete user scenarios from registration to administration.

## Prerequisites
- Backend server running on port 4000 with authentication APIs
- Frontend React application running on development server
- Test database with clean state (no existing users)
- Admin user created for admin interface testing

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Registration Flow
**Objective**: Verify new users can successfully register accounts

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to registration page (`/register`)
2. Fill registration form:
   - Email: `testuser@example.com`
   - Password: `TestPassword123`
   - Confirm Password: `TestPassword123`
3. Submit registration form
4. Verify successful registration
5. Verify automatic login after registration
6. Verify redirect to main flashcard interface

**Expected Results**:
- Registration form accepts valid input
- Server creates new user account
- User is automatically logged in
- Navigation shows authenticated user state
- User has access to flashcard features

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Check user was created in database
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" | jq '.users[] | select(.email=="testuser@example.com")'

# Verify user token works
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/auth/profile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN"
```

### Scenario 2: Existing User Login Flow  
**Objective**: Verify registered users can authenticate successfully

**Steps**:
1. Logout if currently authenticated
2. Navigate to login page (`/login`)
3. Fill login form:
   - Email: `testuser@example.com`
   - Password: `TestPassword123`
4. Submit login form
5. Verify successful authentication
6. Verify redirect to main application
7. Test logout functionality

**Expected Results**:
- Login form accepts credentials
- Server validates authentication
- User is logged in with proper session
- Protected routes become accessible
- Logout clears authentication state

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Test login API directly
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"testuser@example.com","password":"TestPassword123"}'

# Verify token expiration handling
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/auth/profile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token"
```

### Scenario 3: User Profile Management
**Objective**: Verify users can manage their profile information

**Steps**:
1. Login as regular user
2. Navigate to profile page (`/profile`)
3. Verify current profile information is displayed
4. Update email address to `updateduser@example.com`
5. Submit profile update
6. Verify profile changes are saved
7. Test password change functionality:
   - Current Password: `TestPassword123`
   - New Password: `UpdatedPassword123`
8. Verify new password works for login

**Expected Results**:
- Profile page displays current user data
- Email update saves successfully
- Password change requires current password verification
- Updated credentials work for subsequent logins
- Form validation prevents invalid updates

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Verify profile update
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/auth/profile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN"

# Test login with new password
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"updateduser@example.com","password":"UpdatedPassword123"}'
```

---

### Scenario 4: Admin User Management Interface
**Objective**: Verify admin users can manage other users through admin interface

**Setup**:
```bash
# Create admin user (run once)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"AdminPassword123"}'

# Manually promote to admin in database or via direct DB update
```

**Steps**:
1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to admin panel (`/admin`)
3. Verify admin navigation is available
4. Navigate to user management (`/admin/users`)
5. Verify user list displays all users
6. Test user search functionality
7. Select a regular user for management
8. Test user role promotion:
   - Promote regular user to admin
   - Verify role change in user list
9. Test user role demotion:
   - Demote user back to regular user
   - Verify role change
10. Test user deletion:
    - Select a test user for deletion
    - Confirm deletion with modal
    - Verify user is removed from list

**Expected Results**:
- Admin panel is accessible only to admin users
- User list displays all system users with pagination
- Search functionality filters users correctly
- Role promotion/demotion works correctly
- User deletion requires confirmation and removes user
- Admin cannot delete their own account
- All admin actions provide feedback to user

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Verify admin can access user list
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Test role promotion
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/users/2" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"admin"}'

# Test user deletion
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/users/3" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Verify regular user cannot access admin endpoints
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN"
```

### Scenario 5: Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Objective**: Verify system handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

**Steps**:
1. Test registration with duplicate email:
   - Attempt to register with existing email
   - Verify appropriate error message
2. Test login with invalid credentials:
   - Submit wrong password
   - Verify error message and no authentication
3. Test form validation:
   - Submit registration with weak password
   - Submit login with invalid email format
   - Verify client-side validation prevents submission
4. Test unauthorized access:
   - Access admin routes as regular user
   - Access protected routes without authentication
   - Verify proper redirects and error messages
5. Test network error handling:
   - Simulate server downtime
   - Verify loading states and error recovery

**Expected Results**:
- All error conditions display user-friendly messages
- Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- Unauthorized access attempts are handled properly
- Network errors don't crash the application
- Loading states provide feedback during async operations

### Scenario 6: Responsive Design Validation
**Objective**: Verify interfaces work correctly on different screen sizes

**Steps**:
1. Test on desktop (1200px+):
   - Verify full layout with sidebar navigation
   - Test admin interface table layouts
2. Test on tablet (768px-1199px):
   - Verify responsive navigation
   - Test form layouts adapt correctly
3. Test on mobile (320px-767px):
   - Verify mobile-friendly forms
   - Test navigation menu functionality
   - Verify admin interface remains usable

**Expected Results**:
- All interfaces are fully functional on all screen sizes
- Forms remain usable and accessible
- Navigation adapts appropriately
- Admin interface remains functional on smaller screens
- Text remains readable at all sizes

## Performance Validation

### Authentication Performance
**Objective**: Verify authentication operations meet performance targets

**Tests**:
```bash
# Test login response time (should be <500ms)
time curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"testuser@example.com","password":"TestPassword123"}'

# Test user list load time for admin (should be <2s)
time curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### Frontend Performance
**Metrics to Verify**:
- Page load time <2s
- Form submission feedback <100ms
- Navigation transitions <200ms
- Authentication state updates <100ms

## Cleanup and Reset

### Reset Test Environment
```bash
# Clear test users (keep admin for next test run)
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/users/USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Clear authentication tokens
# (Clear localStorage/cookies in browser dev tools)
```
