# Implementation Plan: End-to-End Testing Suite with Playwright

**Branch**: `005-crea-las-pruebas` | **Date**: 2025-09-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/julianmican/Documents/Personal/flash-cards/specs/005-crea-las-pruebas/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create comprehensive end-to-end testing suite using Playwright and Jest for the flashcard application, covering all user flows including authentication, flashcard management, spaced repetition, and admin functionality. Migration of existing tests to Jest framework for consistency.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript/Node.js (React 19 frontend, Express.js backend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Playwright, Jest, @playwright/test, supertest  
**Storage**: SQLite database (better-sqlite3), test database isolation  
**Testing**: Jest with Playwright for E2E, migrate existing tests to Jest  
**Target Platform**: Web application (cross-browser testing)
**Project Type**: web - frontend + backend with existing structure  
**Performance Goals**: E2E tests complete <30s, individual tests <5s  
**Constraints**: Must work with existing JWT auth, test isolation required  
**Scale/Scope**: Cover 12+ functional requirements, ~20-30 test scenarios

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**: ✅ PASS
- Projects: 1 (existing web app with additional E2E testing)
- Using framework directly? Yes (Playwright + Jest, no wrappers)
- Single data model? Yes (test entities mirror production entities)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (no unnecessary abstractions)

**Architecture**: ✅ PASS
- EVERY feature as library? E2E tests as self-contained test library
- Libraries listed: E2E Testing Suite (browser automation and validation)
- CLI per library: npm scripts for test execution (--help/--version support)
- Library docs: Quickstart.md provides comprehensive documentation

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: ✅ PASS
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes (contracts define failing tests first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Will be enforced in tasks
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes (contracts created first)
- Real dependencies used? Yes (actual database, real browser, real auth)
- Integration tests for: new testing infrastructure, API contracts, user flows
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**: ✅ PASS
- Structured logging included? Test reports, trace files, screenshots
- Frontend logs → backend? Test execution logs unified
- Error context sufficient? Playwright provides full error context

**Versioning**: ✅ PASS
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0 (initial E2E test suite)
- BUILD increments on every change? Will follow semantic versioning
- Breaking changes handled? Test migration strategy documented

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - existing frontend/backend structure with test directories

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
