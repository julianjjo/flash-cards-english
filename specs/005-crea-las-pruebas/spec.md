## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Quality assurance engineers need comprehensive end-to-end tests that validate all critical user journeys in the flashcard application, ensuring the system works correctly from a user's perspective across all features including authentication, flashcard management, spaced repetition learning, and administrative functions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the application, **When** they register and create their first flashcard, **Then** they should be able to review it with text-to-speech functionality
2. **Given** an existing user with flashcards, **When** they complete study sessions over time, **Then** the spaced repetition algorithm should adjust card difficulty and review scheduling
3. **Given** an administrator, **When** they access the admin dashboard, **Then** they should be able to manage users and view system statistics
4. **Given** a user session expires, **When** they attempt protected actions, **Then** they should be redirected to login without losing their progress
5. **Given** multiple users using the system, **When** they manage their flashcards, **Then** data should be properly isolated between users

### Edge Cases
- What happens when network connectivity is lost during flashcard creation?
- How does the system handle invalid audio generation requests?
- What occurs when a user tries to access admin functions without proper permissions?
- How does the application behave with extremely large flashcard collections?
- What happens when TTS service is unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST validate complete user registration and login flows
- **FR-002**: Test suite MUST verify flashcard CRUD operations for authenticated users
- **FR-003**: Test suite MUST validate spaced repetition learning algorithm behavior
- **FR-004**: Test suite MUST test text-to-speech functionality for flashcards
- **FR-005**: Test suite MUST verify admin dashboard functionality and user management
- **FR-006**: Test suite MUST validate user data isolation between different accounts
- **FR-007**: Test suite MUST test authentication token refresh and session management
- **FR-008**: Test suite MUST verify responsive design across different screen sizes
- **FR-009**: Test suite MUST test error handling for all critical user actions
- **FR-010**: Test suite MUST validate performance of key user interactions
- **FR-011**: Test suite MUST test accessibility compliance for key user flows
- **FR-012**: Test suite MUST verify proper handling of concurrent user sessions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test User Accounts**: Different user roles (regular user, admin) with known credentials and data sets
- **Test Flashcards**: Predefined flashcard collections for consistent testing scenarios
- **Test Sessions**: Reproducible study session data to validate spaced repetition logic
- **Test Environment**: Isolated database and services for test execution without affecting production data
